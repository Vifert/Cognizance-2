>Starting your own clothing line should be driven by a need to want to make a positive contribution to the decision-making process and not to keep the consumption machine going.
starting a clothing line is an art, but it's also a business.



>Without creativity and design, you won't succeed. You also need to have a strong foundation in business and finance to make your clothing ecommerce business the full package.
It's like your self driven motive and keen interest in fashion that drives the passion ahead, this is like the main motive.

>1. Finding my business niche.
    Finding a niche is an important process of starting any business
2. Identifying my target audience.
    Identifying your target audience will help you make these choices and narrow down your brand identity. 
3. Performing a competitive analysis.
    A competitive analysis is an assessment of your current or potential business competitors.
    To perform one, you must identify the other companies in your market that currently offer a product similar to yours, and then analyze how their products are positioned
    This analysis has to be done.
4. Writing a business plan.
    A business plan serves as the blueprint of your business and helps you see the full picture of your company's mission, vision and feasibility.
5. File your legal structure.
    obtain a tax ID number and know on which business licenses I may need. I will also want to look into obtaining the appropriate business insurance.
6. Secure financing.
     We'll likely need to borrow money to fund our business through a small business loan. 
     We may also consider working in the fashion industry or in a clothing store to not only learn the ropes of the industry, but also save some money to fund your company.
7. Find your storefront.
     Once we've narrowed down our location options, we'll need to find the right building.
8. Set up your online store.
     When we are looking for a website-building platform to create our online clothing store, it is important to find one that is affordable, easy to use and optimized for mobile users. 
     Some companies even offer retail-specific web design templates, which can simplify the e-commerce store building process.
This is where our website landing page experienced ideas will come to use.
9. Purchase and price your inventory.
     The ORACULUS STILLISTA is a fashion brand which has to be priced based on it's quality.
10. Establish policies.
     Anticipate problems or questions that might arise concerning employees, store hours, customer service, loss prevention, damages, returns and other day-to-day operations. 
     Consider best practices from other established stores, and distribute materials explaining these procedures to all new employees.
11. Market your store.
     When we're ready to open our doors (physically or virtually), we shouldn't be afraid to tell everyone, from friends and family to all your social media connections. 
     Make sure you have a message to share with them and reasons they should shop at our new store.
